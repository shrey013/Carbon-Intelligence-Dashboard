# 🧠 Project Aim
To build an **interactive emissions dashboard** that helps users understand:

- Which sectors emit the most  
- How emissions change over time  
- How individuals contribute to CO₂ footprint  
- How AI can simplify climate intelligence  

The dashboard empowers better decisions through clean visuals and guided AI responses.

# 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize **global emissions by sector**  
- Provide **AI chatbot** for climate-related questions  
- Calculate **personal carbon footprint**  
- Stream **climate news ticker**  
- Show **climate-related stock ticker** with animated green/red arrows  
- Add animated earth and responsive UI  
- Fully responsive for desktop/mobile

# 🏆 What Problem Does This Solve?

Climate data is usually:

- Hard to understand  
- Spread across many sources  
- Not visually engaging  
- Not interactive  

This dashboard solves that by providing:

- **All emissions insights in one place**  
- **Simple visual explanations**  
- **AI-generated climate intelligence**  
- **Personal footprint estimation**  
- **Live-style data visual experience**  

This helps students, employees, policy researchers, and general users instantly understand climate impact.
